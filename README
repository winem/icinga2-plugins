This repo is a fork of https://github.com/BarbarossaTM/icinga2-plugins 

Actually I just wanted to fix two typos in the check_conntrack_size plugin but since I was just there I did some more stuff:
  - it's "python3ified" now
  - performance data are provided with the check result
  - unnecessary `sudo` got removed from the command example

The other modules were not modified yet. I might setup a bird and migrate the 3 other checks to Python3, too, and create a PR.
